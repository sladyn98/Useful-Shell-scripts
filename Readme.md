This is a list of all the bash Scripts I have written for daily use.
Feel Free to use this list

# Scripts

a) jump.sh : A simple bash script to move up to desired directory level directly. I wrote this while learning linux scripting.

b) readCSV.sh : Script to read a csv file with username, DOB, telephone, status etc.

c) backup.sh: Script used to real time file sync daemon using Rsync and Inotify.

d) cleanout.sh: This script hits a list of target directories and lists all the files that irritate me and asks, "Delete [y/n]?". When the confirmation comes it deletes the file or else they decline it. You can modify the files you want to delete using the extension. For eg .o files, or .log files.

e) extract.sh: Ever forget how to extract the various types of files in linux. Worry not, I present you with extract.sh. This is used to extract all the files according to type of extension.

f) weather.sh: Get the weather right in your terminal using this script.

g) delete.sh: Delete empty directories.
